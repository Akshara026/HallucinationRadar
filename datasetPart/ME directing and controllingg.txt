1.0Directing:
Direction means issuance of orders and leading and motivating subordinates as they go about executing orders.

 According to Haimann,“Directing consists of the process  and techniques utilized in issuing  instructions and making certain that operations are carried on as originally planned.

 According to Koontz and O’Donnell,“Direction is the  interpersonal aspect of managing by which subordinates are led to understand and contribute effectively and efficiently to the attainment of enterprise objectives.
Directing function consists of issuing orders and instructions, guiding and helping subordinates to perform their tasks effectively and efficiently so as to achieve organizational goals.

1.1 Functions:
 	Giving orders to employees.
 	Leading and motivating them.
 
 	The three important components of directing function are:
 	Communicating
 	Leading
 	Motivating

1.2 Requirements or Nature of effective Direction:
 Harmony of Objectives – An organisation functions best  when the goals of its members are in complete harmony with and complementary to the goals of the organisation.

 Unity of Command –This principle implies that the  subordinates should receive orders and instructions from one superior only.The violation of this principle may lead to conflicting orders, divided loyalties and decreased personal responsibility for results.

 Direct Supervision – Every superior must maintain direct  face-to-face contact with his subordinates. Direct supervision boosts the morale of employees, increases their loyalty and provides them with immediate feedback on how well they are doing.


Efficient Communication – It is through  communication that the superior gives orders, allocates jobs, explains duties and ensures performance. Efficient communication not only enables the superior to know how his subordinates feel but also helps the subordinates to know how the company feels on a number of issues concerning them.

Follow-through – The manager should follow through  the whole performance of his subordinates not merely to keep a check on their activities but to help them in their act, to show them where their deficiency, if any, lies and to revise their direction if it needs revision, and so on.

2.0 Leadership
 According to Peter Drucker, “ Leadership is the lifting of   man’s visions to higher sights, the raising of man’s performance to a higher standard, the building of man’s personality beyond its normal limitations.
 Leadership is the ability to persuade others to seek   defined objectives enthusiastically.
 Leadership is defined as the ability to influence people  towards accomplishment of goals. It is the ability to influence behavior of others and direct them towards achievement of group behavior of others and direct them towards achievement of group or organisational goals.

2.1 Characteristics of Leadership
 Leadership possess great influential power.
 Leaders have followers and they influence the behavior of   followers.

 Leaders have a great vision for future.
 There is a reciprocal relationship between leaders and   followers.
 Leaders create a shared vision among followers and direct   them to work towards the achievement of common goals.
 Leadership is situational and effectiveness of leaders is  influenced by situational variables like environment, interpersonal relationship, job content, group relations, size of group, group norms etc.

2.2 Importance of Leadership
 Leaders guide and inspire subordinates: leaders motivate their  followers and guide them towards accomplishment of group goals which in turn contributes to the accomplishment of organisational goals.

 Leaders build good work environment: leaders create a work   environment in which employees can contribute by performing to the best of their abilities. The environment creates a relationship based on trust.

 Leaders build confidence in followers: leaders recognise abilities of   their followers and encourage them to develop to their potential by building confidence in them.

 Leaders secure cooperation from the group: leaders  influences the group-members in such a way that all the members work collectively towards group objectives and thus in still cooperation among all members.

Leaders act as change agents: organisations operate in an environment which is subjected to continuous changes, and if the organisations do not respond to these changes, then survival of the organisation may be difficult. But organisational members resist any changes, as they are accustomed to particular methods of work. It requires great leadership to reduce the resistance to change and convince the employees to accept the change.Thus leaders act as change agents of the organisation and helps in implementing successful positive changes in the in the organisation.


 Leaders are representatives of the followers: on  one hand leaders direct the employees of the organisation, but on the other hand they are also representatives of their followers.They always take personal interest in helping their followers.They always take personal interest in helping their followers and protect the interest of the followers while taking any major organisational decisions.

 Leaders develop great vision: leaders are known for  their great vision and they develop the vision for building great organisations.

2.3 Difference between managers and leaders
   2.3.1 Managers

Manager’s position is based on formal authority defined by the organisational structure.

Managers get work done through subordinates by exercising authority.

Managers are rational and logical in their decision-making.

Managers execute plans, implement them, and produce results.

Managers exercise positional power.
  2.3.2 Leaders
Leader’s position is based on personality and influence, not formally defined by the organisation.

Leaders inspire followers and make them work towards common/shared objectives.

Leaders are visionary and future-oriented.

Leaders articulate vision, inspire, and motivate followers to achieve common goals.

Leaders exercise personal power rather than positional power.


2.4 Leadership styles

2.4.1Autocratic Leadership :
In this type of leadership, the leader alone  determines policies and makes plans. He tells orders what to do and how to do it. He demands strict obedience and relies on power.The formula used by him is “Do what I say or else …” meaning thereby that an employee will be punished if he does not follow orders. This style of leadership is also called as dictatorship.
Advantages:
• Quick and consistent decisions are made.
• Leaders enforce strict discipline among followers and get the work
done by making use of fear of punishment and rewarding power.
• Suitable when subordinates are inexperienced and need
direction from leaders.
Disadvantages:
• Low motivation among subordinates.
• One way communication may result in misunderstanding.
Too much dependence on leadership.

2.4.2Democratic Leadership:
 In this type of leadership (also  known as participative or person-oriented leadership), the entire group is involved in and accepts responsibility for goal setting and achievement. Subordinates have considerable freedom of action.The leader shows greater concern for his people than for high production. A part of the leader’s task is to encourage and reinforce constructive inter-relationships among members and to reduce intra-group conflict and tensions.
Advantages:
• Better decisions are made.
• Provides opportunity for managerial development.
• Interests of followers are protected.
Disadvantages:
• Very slow decision making and timely decisions are not made.
• Maintaining discipline is very difficult.
• Requires high maturity in followers.

2.5.2Free Rein:
In this type of leadership, the leader exercises absolutely no   control. He only provides information, materials and facilities to his men to enable them to accomplish group objectives. This type can be a disaster if the leader does not know well the competence and integrity of his people and their ability to handle this kind of freedom. Hence this style of leadership may not be suitable in all the situations and it requires subordinates who are knowledgeable, well trained and highly self motivated.
Advantages:
• Brings in innovation and creativity.
• Can bring high motivation among subordinates and thus
develop managerial skills among subordinates.
• Highly flexible.
Disadvantages:
• Lack of control
• May result in confusion and chaos.
• Needs highly matured and knowledgeable subordinates.


3 Motivation

  Motivation is the process of stimulating people to action to accomplish desired goals. Motivation represents inner drive within an individual which directs him to behave in specific way.
 Motivation is the process of challenging a person’s inner   drives so that he wants to accomplish the goals of the organisation.
 The three key elements of motivation are:
 Energy
 Direction
 Persistence
3.1 Relation between motivation and needs
Unsatisfied Need: Motivation begins when an individual feels a need that is not fulfilled (such as need for money, recognition, or security).

Tension: The unsatisfied need creates tension or discomfort within the individual.

Drives: This tension leads to drives, which are inner forces that push the person to act in order to reduce the tension.

Behaviour: Drives result in goal-directed behaviour. The individual takes action to satisfy the need (for example, working harder to earn rewards).

Performance: The behaviour leads to a certain level of performance, depending on the effort and ability of the individual.

Reward: Performance is followed by rewards, which may be monetary (salary, bonus) or non-monetary (praise, promotion).

Need Satisfaction or Dissatisfaction: If the reward meets the need, the need is satisfied. If not, the individual feels dissatisfied.

Reduction or Increase in Tension: If the need is satisfied, tension is reduced. If the need remains unsatisfied, tension increases, and the cycle of motivation starts again.

3.2 Abraham Maslow’s Hierarchy of Needs – Explanation

Abraham Maslow proposed that human behaviour is motivated by needs, and these needs are arranged in a hierarchy based on their importance. According to him, people try to satisfy lower-level needs first, and once these are reasonably satisfied, they move towards higher-level needs.

Step 1: Physiological Needs

These are the basic survival needs of human life.
They arise from the physiology of the body.

Examples:

Food ,Water, Air, Shelter, Sleep

 These needs are the most urgent.
 If these needs are not satisfied, a person cannot think of anything else.

Example:
A hungry person will focus only on getting food and will not think about social status or self-development.

Step 2: Safety / Security Needs

Once physiological needs are satisfied, people seek security and protection.

Examples: Job security, Stable income, Protection from physical harm, Safe working conditions

 These needs create a feeling of freedom from fear and threat.
 Both economic security and physical safety are included.

Step 3: Social Needs

After safety needs are fulfilled, people desire social relationships.

Examples: Love and affection, Friendship, Belongingness, Acceptance by others
Humans are social beings and want to associate with others.
Lack of social acceptance can lead to loneliness and dissatisfaction.

Step 4: Esteem Needs

These needs relate to self-respect and recognition from others.

Examples: Respect, Status, Prestige, Recognition

Feeling of dominance or achievement

 These needs are also called egoistic needs.
 Fulfilment of esteem needs increases confidence and self-worth.

Step 5: Self-Actualization (Self-Fulfillment) Needs

This is the highest level of Maslow’s hierarchy.

These needs relate to realising one’s full potential and becoming what one is capable of becoming.

Examples:

A musician creating music, A poet writing poetry, A person pursuing creativity, growth, and personal excellence

 It is about personal growth and fulfillment, not material rewards.
 Very few people reach this level completely.

3.2.1 Maslow’s Core Assumptions

Human needs are arranged in a hierarchy of importance.
A satisfied need no longer motivates behaviour.
Once a lower-level need is satisfied, the next higher need becomes dominant.

Example:
A starving person will not be interested in yoga, meditation, social approval, or prestige. Only after hunger is satisfied will higher needs become important.

Limitations of Maslow’s Theory
1. Needs do not always follow a strict hierarchy

People may seek higher-level needs even when lower-level needs are not fully satisfied.

Example:
An artist may pursue creativity despite financial insecurity.

2. Needs vary across countries and cultures
The priority of needs differs from one society to another.

Example:
Workers in Spain and Belgium may value esteem needs more than security needs.

3. Human behaviour is motivated by multiple needs
People may be motivated by several needs at the same time, not just one.
 This contradicts Maslow’s assumption that needs are satisfied one at a time.

3.3 Herzberg’s Two-Factor Theory
🞂 According to Herzberg, the absence of certain job factors tend to 
make  workers dissatisfied. However, the presence of these same 
factors in themselves does not produce high levels of motivation. 
They merely help avoid dissatisfaction and the problems it 
creates, such as absenteeism, turnover and grievances. Herzberg 
called these factors maintenance or hygiene factors since they 
are necessary to maintain a reasonable level of satisfaction. Ten 
maintenance factors, namely:
Fair company policies and administration.
A supervisor who knows the work.
A good relationship with one’s supervisor.
A good relationship with one’s peers.
A good relationship with one’s subordinates.
A fair salary.
Job security
Personal life
Good working conditions
Status
To build high levels of motivation, a different set of factors is 
necessary. However, if these factors are not present, they do 
not in themselves lead to strong dissatisfaction. Herzberg 
called these the motivators or satisfiers. These are six in 
number:
• Opportunity to accomplish something significant
• Recognition for significant accomplishments.
• Chance for advancement.
• Opportunity to grow and develop on the job.
• Chance for increased responsibility.
• The job itself.
In the absence of maintenance factors, workers may feel 
dissatisfied. There may be more absences, more quits and 
more grievances in union organisations. But the presence of 
these factors does not motivate them. Similarly, in the 
presence of motivators, workers may feel motivated but 
their absence does not make them dissatisfied.

3.4 Theory X and Theory Y
  According to Douglas McGregor managers hold two sets of 
assumptions about their subordinates. Mangers assume that their 
subordinates belong to either of two categories called category X 
and category Y

McGregor proposed that theory X and theory Y are 
important tools in understanding human behaviour 
at work and designing work environment. Neither 
the two sets of assumptions are applicable in all 
situations. But theory X is more applicable to 
unskilled and uneducated lower level employees 
who may be working for satisfaction of lower level 
needs.Theory Y is applicable to educated, skilled 
and professional employees who are capable of 
taking up responsibility. However they can be 
exceptions.

3.4.1Theory X Assumptions

Theory X is based on a traditional and pessimistic view of employees. According to this theory, managers believe that employees naturally dislike work and will try to avoid it whenever possible. Because of this attitude, employees need to be closely supervised, directed, and controlled. Managers using Theory X assume that workers must be threatened with punishment or strict discipline to ensure that work is completed.

Further, Theory X assumes that employees avoid responsibility, prefer to be directed, and do not want accountability. Such employees are believed to lack ambition and mainly seek job security above everything else. As a result, management relies heavily on authority, control, and coercion to achieve organisational goals.

3.4.2 Theory Y Assumptions

Theory Y presents a modern and optimistic view of employees. It assumes that employees enjoy work, just as they enjoy play or rest, when the working conditions are favourable. According to this theory, people are capable of self-direction and self-control if they are committed to organisational objectives.

Theory Y also assumes that employees accept and even seek responsibility, and they are capable of handling responsibilities at all levels of the organisation. It believes that creativity and problem-solving abilities are widely distributed among employees, including those at lower levels. Therefore, employees can participate in decision-making and contribute innovative ideas.

Managers following Theory Y focus on motivation, trust, participation, and empowerment rather than strict control.




3.5McClelland’s Need for Achievement Theory
🞂 According to McClelland, the three important 
needs are   the need for affiliation, the need for 
power and the need for achievement.The need for 
affiliation reflects a desire to interact socially with 
people. A person with a high need for affiliation is 
concerned about the quality of an important 
personal relationship.Thus, social relationships 
take precedence over task accomplishment for 
such a person.
🞂 A person who has a high need for power 
concentrates on   obtaining and exercising power 
and authority.The person is concerned with 
influencing others and winning arguments.
1.
🞂 A person who has a high need for achievement has three 
distinct   characteristics. These are:
Preference for setting moderately difficult but 
potentially achievable goals.
2.Doing most things himself rather than getting them 
done by others. He wants to take personal 
responsibility for his success or failure and does not 
want to hold others or chance responsible for it.
3. Seeking situations where concrete feedback is 
possible. If the needs of employees can be 
accurately measured,
organisations can improve the selection and placement
processes. For eg. An employee or recruit with a high 
need for achievement could be placed in a position 
that would enable the person to achieve.
4. Communication
 Communication – Latin word ‘communis’ means 
common.
🞂 According to Allen Louis-Communication is the sum of 
all the   things, a person does when he wants to create 
an understanding in the mind of another. It involves a 
systematic and continuous process of telling, listening 
and understanding.
🞂 According to George Terry -Communication is an 
exchange of   facts, ideas, opinions or emotions, by two 
or more persons.
  Communication is the process of transmission of 
information or message from one person to another. It 
involves exchange of information, facts, ideas, 
feelings etc between two or more individuals.

4.1Example of Two-Way Communication – Explanation

Ideation
Ideation refers to the formation of an idea. In this example, the idea is to circulate an organisation’s policy among all employees through a news bulletin.

Encoding
Encoding means converting the idea into a communicable form. Here, the editor or the person responsible writes the policy in suitable language and format so that employees can understand it.

Message
The message consists of the actual content of the policy, including the details and the words or pictures used to convey the policy clearly to employees.

Channel
The channel is the medium used to transmit the message. In this case, the policy is communicated through a news bulletin.

Receiver
The receivers are the employees for whom the policy is intended and who read the news bulletin.

Feedback
Feedback refers to the response of the employees after receiving the message. Employees may express their opinions, suggestions, or concerns about the policy.

4.2Importance of communication in Management
🞂 Sense of unity of purpose and commitment to a single 
organisational goal can be developed only through the 
inspiring and persuasive power of communication.
🞂 Training and development programmes can be conducted 
through effective communication.
🞂 In order to appraise employees, performance standards 
must be   properly and clearly communicated.
🞂 In order to increase employee’s job performance and 
effectiveness by updating their knowledge.
To promote employees sense of belonging and commitment.
To effect changes smoothly.
🞂 To inform and convince employees about decisions and the 
reasons behind those decisions.
🞂 To develop employees’ clear understanding of their roles and 
future   growth opportunities in the organization.
🞂 Resolving disputes in organizations , which lead to huge losses of time, money and good human relations.

4.3Communication according to organisational structure
🞂 Formal Channel of Communication – Means of  
communication that is formally controlled by managers 
or people occupying positions in an organization.This 
ensures that the information flows orderly, in a timely 
and accurate manner. Any information, decision, memo 
or reminder etc. will also follow this path.
🞂 Informal Channel of communication- Side by side 
with   the formal channel of communication every 
organization has an equally effective channel of 
communication namely that is the informal channel. 
Given the name ‘grapevine’ precisely because it runs 
in horizontal, vertical and diagonal directions. It flows 
around water coolers, down hallways, through lunch breaks, and through casual conversations. Messages spread quickly through this channel, often faster than formal communication.

4.4 Communication according to Direction
Communication is multidimensional or 
multidirectional.
There are various directions in which it flows.
4.4.1 Vertical Communication:
❑Downward Communication: Communication which flows from 
supervisor to the subordinate is known as downward 
communication. They include orders, rules, instructions etc. 
their nature is directive.
❑Upward Communication: this is just reverse of the 
downward communication. It flows from subordinate to 
supervisor. Each communication includes reactions and 
suggestions from workers, their grievances etc. the contents 
of the upward communication are reports, suggestions, 
reaction, statements and proposals prepared for submissions 
to the supervisor

4.4.2Lateral or horizontal communication
When communication takes place between two or more 
persons who are subordinates working under the same 
person, or those who are working at the same level, it is 
called lateral or horizontal communication. A good example 
of this kind of communication is that between functional 
managers. They are serving the organisation in different 
capacities but their goals are common and their interaction 
is necessary to maintain co-ordination.
The best example of lateral communication can be seen in 
the interaction of production and marketing departments. 
Strategies of marketing cannot be fruitful unless plans are 
communicated to the production department. The 
Marketing Manager has to be in constant touch with the 
Production Manager, in order to meet customer orders as 
per schedule.

4.5 Communication according to the way of expression

4.5.1 Oral communication: in this type of communication 
both parties to the process of communication 
exchange their ideas orally either face to face or 
through devices like phone, intercoms etc, 
meetings, conference, lecturers, interviews etc.

4.5.2  Written communication: in this type of 
communication,   written words, graphs, diagrams, 
pictures etc are used. They may take forms of 
circulars, rules, manuals, reports, memos etc.

4.6 Barriers to communication
 4.6.1 Individual barriers
Conflicting signals: difference in what one 
says and what he does
Lack of reliable information sources
Lack of interest to communicate
Poor listening skills
 Overcoming Individual Barriers: Develop good listening skill, Encourage two way communication
4.6.2 Organizational Barriers
Semantics : Misinterpretation of words, same 
word having different meaning
Noise
Language differences
Overcoming Organizational Barriers: 
Have proper follow up
Reduce factors which causes noise
Regulate information flow
Be aware of language and meaning


5. Coordination:
 Coordination is the management of 
interdependence  in work situations.
🞂 Coordination can be defined as the orderly  
synchronization or fitting together of the 
interdependent efforts of individuals, in order to 
attain a common goal.
🞂 Coordination deals with the task of blending efforts 
in  order to ensure the successful attainment of an 
objective. It is accomplished by means of planning, 
organizing and controlling.
5.1. Importance of Coordination
🞂 Unity in diversity: organisations are made up of people 
and   people do have their own individual interests. 
Hence good coordination ensures that people works 
towards common goal rather than their own personal 
interests.
🞂 Specialization: the splitting of work into smaller and 
smaller   units through division of work creates the 
need for coordination among many individuals who 
need to complete the full task.
Teamwork: employees work in form of tt eam to 
complete a project or activity undertaken by the 
organisation. Hence individual efforts has to be 
synchronized to obtain overall outcome of the 
team.This in turn creates a sense of shared vision 
among the team.

Communication: effective communication is very 
much   essential for coordination. Communication 
ensures harmonious relations among the individuals 
and different departments.
🞂 Recognition of goals: defining clear objectives ensures  
clarity of role and responsibility among individuals 
resulting in better coordination.
🞂 Interdependency: organisation are made up of various 
units   and departments, which are interdependent. For 
example, Marketing department depends on production 
department for timely supply of products and services 
to customers. Coordination function ensures that this 
interdependence needs are met by ensuring good 
relations among all departments.

5.2. Techniques of Coordination
🞂 Rules, Procedures, and Policies – Common device to coordinate 
sub-units  in the performance of their repetitive activities. Standard 
policies, procedures and rules are laid down to cover all possible 
situations.
🞂 Planning – Under planning targets of each department, coordinate 
with the  targets of all other departments. For eg. By fixing the 
target of 10000 units of additional production and sales for the 
production and sales departments respectively, the head of the 
organization can be fairly sure that the work of the two departments 
would be coordinated since their target so demand.
🞂 Hierarchy – By putting interdependent units under one boss, 
some  coordination among their activities is ensured.
Direct Contact- In order to prevent top executives from becoming 
overloaded with problems, as many problems as possible are 
resolved by the affected employees at lower levels.
🞂 Task force – This is a temporary group made up of representatives 
from  those departments which are facing a problem. It exists only 
as long as the
problem lasts.

Incentives- incentives like profit sharing ensures that people 
work  towards common objectives and they motivate them to 
work with each other for timely completion of tasks.
🞂 Committees – As certain decisions consistently arise the task 
forces  become permanent.These groups are labeled 
committees.This device greatly eases the rigidity of the 
hierarchical structure, promotes effective communication and 
understanding of ideas, encourages the acceptance of the 
commitment to policies and makes their implementation more 
effective.
🞂 Induction – The device familiarizes the new employee with the  
organization's rules and regulations, its dominant norms of 
behavior, values and beliefs, and integrates his personal goals with 
the organisational goals.
🞂 Liaison Departments – In some cases where there is a large volume 
of  contact between two departments, a liaison department 
evolves to handle the transactions.This typically occurs between 
sales and production departments.
🞂 Workflow – A workflow is the sequence of steps by which the  
organization acquires inputs and transforms them into 
outputs and exports these to the environment. It helps in 
coordination.

6.Control
🞂 Control is checking current performance against  
predetermined standards contained in the plans, 
with a view to ensuring adequate progress and 
satisfactory performance.
🞂 George Terry: “controlling is determining what is 
being   accomplished that is evaluating the 
performance, and if necessary, applying correct 
measures so that the performance takes place 
according to plans”

6.1 Purpose of Control

Control is an important managerial function that helps the organization achieve its goals efficiently and effectively. The main purposes of control are explained below:

1. Adapt to Environmental Changes

The business environment is dynamic and continuously changing due to factors such as technology, competition, government policies, and customer preferences. Control helps the organization identify these changes early and take corrective actions to adapt accordingly.

2. Limit the Accumulation of Errors

Control helps in detecting mistakes at an early stage. By identifying deviations from standards in time, management can take corrective actions and prevent small errors from becoming major problems.

3. Cope with Organizational Complexity

As organizations grow in size and operations become more complex, it becomes difficult for managers to monitor all activities directly. Control systems help management coordinate various departments and activities, ensuring smooth functioning of the organization.

4. Minimize Costs

Through effective control, wastage of resources can be reduced. It ensures optimum utilization of resources, avoids unnecessary expenses, and helps in cost reduction, thereby improving profitability.

6.2 Steps in a Control Process

Control is a systematic process that ensures organisational activities are performed according to plans. The control process consists of the following steps:

Step 1. Establishing standards
Control standard is a target against which 
subsequent performance will be compared
Some key areas in all business organizations are: 
profitability, market position, productivity and 
personnel development.
1. It should be defined as far as possible in 
quantitative terms. For eg.“overheads must be 
reduced by 12%”.
2. Standards need to be flexible in order to 
adapt to changing conditions.
3. It should be consistent with organizational goals

Step 2: Measuring performance
🞂 Performance measurement is a constant and 
ongoing   activity
 Performance measures must be valid.
🞂 Daily, weekly and monthly sales numbers 
measure sales   performance
🞂 Product quality or units produced or unit 
cost measure   production performance
🞂 Quality or quantity of output measure 
employees   performance

Step 3: Comparing performance against standards
🞂 Measured performance will be compared 
against   established standards
🞂 Performance may be higher than, lower than or 
identical   [equal] to the standard
🞂 If performance is lower than expected manager 
has to   decide how much deviation from 
standard can be allowed before taking remedial 
action
🞂 Comparison is mainly based on the importance 
and   complexity of the activity


Step 4: Corrective action
◻ Courses of Action
“Doing nothing” – maintaining status quo
Only if deviation is judged to be insignificant.
Correcting actual (current) performance or 
deviation
■ Immediate corrective action to correct the 
problem at once.
■ Basic corrective action to locate and to 
correct the source of the deviation.
■ Corrective Actions
■ Change strategy, structure, compensation 
scheme, or training programs; redesign jobs; or 
fire employees

  Revising or change the standard
  Examining the standard to ascertain 
whether or not the standard is realistic, 
fair, and achievable.
◻Upholding the validity of the standard.
◻Resetting goals that were initially set too 
low or too high


6.3. Essentials of effective Control System
 Suitable- The control system should be appropriate 
to the nature and needs of the activity. Controls used 
in the sales department will be different from those 
used in finance and personnel.
🞂 Timely and forward Looking – The control system 
should   be such as to enable the subordinates to 
inform their superiors expeditiously about the 
threatened deviations and failures.The feedback 
system should be as short and quick as possible.
🞂 Objective and Comprehensible – Objective controls  
specify the expected results in clear and definite 
terms and leave little room for argument by the 
employees.
🞂 Flexible – The control system should be flexible so that 
it can   be adjusted to suit the needs of any change in 
the environment.
 
  Economical – The benefit derived from a control 
system   should be more than the cost involved in 
implementing it.
🞂 Prescriptive and Operational – A control system in  
order to be effective and adequate must not only 
detect deviations from the standards but should 
also provide for solutions to the problems that 
cause deviations.
Acceptable to Organization Members
🞂 Motivate people to High Performance – Since most   
people respond to a challenge, successfully 
meeting a tough standard may well provide a 
greater sense of accomplishment than meeting an 
easy standard.

6.4.Types of Control

Managers can exercise control at three different stages of an activity: before, during, and after the activity is completed. Accordingly, there are three types of control:

1. Feedforward Control (Control Before the Activity)

Feedforward control is exercised before the actual activity begins. Its main purpose is to anticipate problems and prevent them from occurring.

It focuses on inputs such as raw materials, manpower, and resources.

It ensures that the right inputs are available in the right quantity and quality.

Example:
Checking the quality of raw materials before production begins.

2. Concurrent Control (Control During the Activity)

Concurrent control is exercised while the activity is in progress. It helps in correcting problems as they occur.

It focuses on processes.

It ensures that activities are performed according to plan in real time.

Example:
A supervisor monitoring workers on the production line to ensure proper work methods are followed.

3. Feedback Control (Control After the Activity)

Feedback control is exercised after the activity has been completed. It helps in correcting problems after they occur and improving future performance.

It focuses on output.

The information obtained is used for future planning and control.

Example:
Analyzing sales reports at the end of the month to evaluate performance

6.5. Comparison of Past-Oriented and Future-Oriented Controls

Control systems can be classified based on the time at which corrective action is taken. Accordingly, they are divided into past-oriented controls and future-oriented controls.

1. Past-Oriented Control (Feedback Control)

Past-oriented control focuses on results that have already been achieved. It is exercised after the activity is completed.

It is based on outputs and performance reports.

Information about actual performance is collected and compared with standards.

Corrective actions are taken after deviations occur.

It helps management learn from past mistakes and improve future planning.

Example:
Reviewing sales performance at the end of the month and taking corrective steps for the next month.

2. Future-Oriented Control (Feedforward Control)

Future-oriented control focuses on preventing problems before they occur. It is exercised before the activity begins.

It concentrates on inputs and processes.

It anticipates potential problems and takes preventive actions.

It ensures that deviations do not occur in the first place.

Example:

Future-oriented control uses feedforward information from inputs and processes to prevent errors.


6.6. Types of Control Methods
🞂 Past-oriented Control – These are also known as post-action  
controls and measure results after the process.They 
examine what has happened in a particular period in the 
past. Examples of such controls are most accounting 
records, inspection of goods and services and school grade 
reports.These controls can be used to plan future behavior 
in the light of past errors or successes.
🞂 Concurrent Control-Takes place while an activity is in 
progress.  Best known form of this type is DIRECT 
SUPERVISION.When managers use management by walking 
around, where they visit floor and contact employees 
directly, they are using concurrent control. Ex: while typing 
in a word document, miss spelt words or grammar errors 
are highlighted in a green or red color.Though delay in 
managerial response to problem is there, it is minimal. One 
can reduce the wastage because of damages, as you are 
preventing major damages
 
  Future-oriented control – These are also known as  
steering controls or feed forward controls and are 
designed to measure results during the process so 
that action can be taken before the job is done or 
the period is over.They serve as warning-posts 
principally to direct attention rather than to 
evaluate. Examples of such controls are cash flow 
and funds flow analysis, network planning etc. 
which enable managers to see that they will have 
problems in such areas as cash or on-time 
delivery.
6.7. Control Techniques
  Budgeting – A budget is a statement of 
anticipated results during a designated time 
period expressed in financial and non-financial 
terms.
🞂 Standard costing – One of the techniques of 
control   and it is being increasingly used by 
modern business concerns for the purpose of cost 
reduction and cost control.
🞂 Financial Statement and Ratio analysis – The   
trading profit and Loss Account and the Balance 
Sheet of a company are the usual financial 
statements which are prepared ex-post to indicate 
what financial events occurred since the last 
statements.
 
  Break-even analysis – It involves the use of a chart 
to   depict the overall volume of sales necessary to 
cover costs. It is that point at which the cost and 
revenue of the enterprise are exactly equal.
🞂 Internal and External Audit – Internal Audit is  
conducted by an internal auditor who is an 
employee of the organisation. He makes an 
independent appraisal of financial and other 
operations.
External Audit is an independent appraisal of 
the organisation’s financial accounts and 
statements.
🞂 Reports – Reports are systematically prepared statements that provide relevant information to management for the purpose of control. They help management evaluate performance, identify deviations from plans, and take timely corrective actions.
